Higher Order function : A function that recieves another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
call() : This is used to call a method that was created inside another object. 
         But now we specify through which object it should be called.

The call method helps in avoid duplicating the code 
const book  = lufthansa.book()
Here, book() was created in the lufthansa object. But now we are specifying it should be called under which object
book.call(euroWings, 'E12312', 'Federer');
