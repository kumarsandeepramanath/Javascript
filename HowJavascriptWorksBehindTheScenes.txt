ProtoTyping : In JS, there is a prototype Ex. Array has a prototype with a list of all properties and methods.
Then using this prototype, objects are created in JS
First-class function : A function in which we treat functions just like variables. Ex. pass function into another function
  function closeModal() {
    modal.classList.add('hidden');
    overlay.classList.add('hidden');
  }
  close.addEventListener('click', closeModal);
