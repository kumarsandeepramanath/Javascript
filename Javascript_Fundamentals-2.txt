hasUser = false // This would throw an error saying that the variable hasUser is not defined

There are 2 ways of creating a function :

//Function declarations
function my_func1(param1){
    .....
}
OR

//Function Expression
const my_func2 = function(param1){

}

Function Declaration can be called before and declared later
Function Expression needs to be declared first and then be called.
